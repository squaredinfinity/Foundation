TYPES
	By default all structures use Double as an underlying type for storage of values.

Coordinates
	By default all coordinates are expressed using Double type.
	Double is widely used to store scientific data and in engineering applications.
	Double is 8 bytes long.

	For very specific situations and performance using Int32 or Float can be considered.
		Int16:	2 bytes, [-32,768; 32,767]
			using Int16 does not make much sense, most systems are now 32 or 64 bit now, there would be no gain from using it.
		Int64:	8 bytes, [-9223372036854775808; 9223372036854775807]
			~18,000,000,000,000,000,000 is a massive amounts of values to store and seems like an overkill for current applications

		Int32:	4 bytes, [-2,147,483,648; 2,147,483,647]
			~4,290,000,000 is a decent amount of values to store and if there's a need to store as many, 
			then memory usage (and savings from using smaller type) must be taken into account
		Double:	8 bytes, [-1.79769313486232e308; 1.79769313486232e308]
			large amount of values to store make it very suitable for most applications
		Float:	4 bytes, [-3.402823e38; 3.402823e38]
			similar to Double, consider when memory consumption is important and precision can be sucrificed
		
		TODO: performance test

	For example, to store 
		10m Double points we need	10m x 8 = 80m bytes = 80 megabytes
		10m Int32 points we need	10m x 4 = 40m bytes = 40 megabytes
		10m Float points we need	10m x 4 = 40m bytes = 40 megabytes
